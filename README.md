# Windows_Calculator_App

## This is a clone of the Windows 10 calculator application

Here, I've tried to create a clone of the windows 10 calculator application. I've made the buttons and it's hover effects look like windows 10 calculator. The 
functionalities are same. And just like the windows calculator, the buttons are accessible from keyboard also.

I've used Python and it's GUI tool Tkinter to create this application.
